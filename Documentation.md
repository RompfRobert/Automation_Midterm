Google Drive API allows you to create apps that leverage Google Drive cloud storage. You can develop applications that integrate with Google Drive, and create robust functionality in your application using Google Drive API.

## Authentication

Every request your application sends to the Drive API must include an authorization token. The token also identifies your application to Google.

Your application must use OAuth 2.0 to authorize requests. No other authorization protocols are supported.
